Welcome to all Points of Contact and Managers of the Earth System
Application Categories supporting the `OSCAR/Requirements <OSCAR-req_>`_ database.

This Manual is a help and cookbook to verify, update, complement and add
data to the OSCAR/Requirements database, such as values associated to
the variables. The methods on how to proposal additional variables are
describes as well.

Much attention is given to the history of `OSCAR/Requirements <OSCAR-req_>`_. It is
relevant to take notice of the development of the database within a
historical context. The vision and ideas developed for decades will
support a better understanding of the structure and contents of the
database. The explanations given refer to this historic background and
give confidence during the complementing exercises.

For this Manual six basic entries are provided:

-  :doc:`Introduction <introduction>`. This section gives a brief introduction and explains
   the relevant items with direct links to the other entries.

-  :doc:`Structure <structure>`. The structure of the OSCAR/Requirements is explained.
   Although the database webpages contain many explanations and
   background details themselves, this entry will help to understand its
   logical structure, based on thought-out recommendations and
   decisions.

-  :doc:`Guidance <cookbook>`. A step-by-step approach for the Points of Contacts and
   EPAC Managers to correctly fill in the database entries (or to add
   variables). This guide is in fact a cookbook with a checklist to
   assist the process of updating.

-  :doc:`Regulatory material <references>`. References are provided to published
   documentation, like Manuals which are part of the WMO Technical
   Regulations, Manuals on OSCAR/Requirements, informative documents
   considered by the WMO Technical Commissions, etcetera.

-  :doc:`History <history>`. A brief overview is provided of the historic development
   of OSCAR/Requirements. An appropriate insight of the history behind
   OSCAR will stimulate the consciousness of how the database is
   developed during the years.
   
-  :doc:`Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) <faq>`. An overview of well-known
   questions with solutions just to help the Points of Contacts to
   reduce confusion and troubleshooting. The list of FAQ will extend and
   updated in due course based on comments and questions submitted by
   the (Application Areas) Point of Contacts and the (Earth System
   Application Category) Managers.
